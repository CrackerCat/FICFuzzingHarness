Foxit Image Converter Fuzzing Harness
<br/><br/>
Since foxit ended up disabling and removing the parsing code of the Image Converter Module, starting from the latest Foxit Reader (Version 10.0.0.35798), I made my fuzzing harness publicly avilable.
<br/><br/>
<b>Note:</b> The Image Convertor module is still avilable on the Foxit PhantomPDF.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Harness is developed for:</b> Foxit Reader version 9.7.1.29511
<br/><br/>
